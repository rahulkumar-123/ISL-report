                learn about the "New Space" industry and bridge the gap between classroom theory and practical
                application. The purpose of this document is to summarize what I learned in each part of the program. We
                learned about different topics, starting with the basics and then moving to harder things. The program
                had a few parts which are described below.</p>

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">We learned about Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), how to build them, and
                how they fly by themselves. This module was very hands-on and provided a good foundation for the rest of

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">We started by building a quadcopter from a kit. This helped us see how
                        all the parts work together and why each component is important. It was a good lesson in
                        mechanical assembly and electronics.</p>

                        <li>Wired up the electronics, including the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs), the Power

                        <li>Learned about battery safety and proper handling procedures for high-discharge LiPo

                        <li>Used a computer with ground control software to set up the drone's firmware and calibrate

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">We also learned about the software side of drones. It was important to
                        test the code in a simulator before trying it on the real drone to ensure it would be safe.</p>

                        <li>Learned how drones use sensors like GPS and IMU to know where they are, and how sensor

                        <li>Studied how PID controllers are tuned to keep the drone stable in the air, preventing it
                            from wobbling or overshooting its target.</li>
                        <li>Looked at how drones can follow a path on a map using a series of GPS waypoints, which are

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">This module was about building a small satellite that fits in a can. We
                did this as a team project, which meant we had to work together, manage our time, and solve problems to
                get it done.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Our team had to build a CanSat to measure background radiation with a
                    Geiger counter. The idea was to see if we could detect changes in radiation as it fell from a
                    height, simulating a probe entering an area with high radiation, like near a solar storm.</p>

                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Measure radiation (counts per minute) and send the data to a computer
                            on the ground in real-time.</li>
                        <li><strong>My Job:</strong> I worked on the Geiger counter payload. This meant I had to get the
                            sensor working, manage its high-voltage power supply, and connect it to the main computer.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> The radio signals from the transmitter were creating
                            electromagnetic interference (EMI) that was messing up the very sensitive sensor readings,
                            giving us false high counts of radiation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> We first tried to solve it with software, but it wasn't enough.
                            So, we wrapped the sensor in some copper foil to act as a simple shield, which blocks some
                            of the radio waves. I also changed the code to pause the sensor readings for the few
                            milliseconds when the radio was transmitting. This combination fixed the problem and our
                            data became much cleaner and more reliable.</li>

                        <li>Compared solid and liquid fuel rockets and their pros and cons, like how solid rockets are
                            simple but liquid rockets are more efficient.</li>
                        <li>Studied how to make rockets fly straight using fins by ensuring the center of pressure is

                        <li>Talked about why large rockets need multiple stages to get to orbit, dropping empty fuel

                        science in action. Before the launch, we used simulation software like OpenRocket to predict how
                        high it would go and to make sure it would be stable. We had to follow a checklist to make sure
                        the launch was safe. The rocket went up and the parachute came out for a safe recovery, so it
                        was a success.</p>
